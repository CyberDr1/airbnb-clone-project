# airbnb-clone-project

## **Objective**

The backend of the Airbnb Clone project is built to deliver a reliable and scalable system for handling user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. It aims to replicate the essential functionalities of Airbnb, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and hosts.


## **Team Roles**

**Backend Developer**

Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side of the application, including implementing API endpoints, defining database schemas, and executing core business logic. Collaborates closely with frontend developers to ensure seamless data flow between the client and server. Also handles data validation, authentication, and integration with third-party services.

**Database Administrator (DBA)**

Oversees the structure, performance, and security of the project’s database systems. This includes designing efficient schemas, managing indexing strategies, and optimizing queries for performance. The DBA is also responsible for backups, recovery plans, and ensuring data integrity throughout the development lifecycle.

**DevOps Engineer**

Manages the deployment pipeline, infrastructure automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. Ensures the backend services are properly scaled, monitored, and highly available in various environments. They also handle incident response, system updates, and maintain secure development and production environments.

**QA Engineer**

Conducts comprehensive testing to verify that backend functionalities work as expected and meet established quality standards. This includes writing and executing unit, integration, and regression tests. The QA Engineer also documents bugs, collaborates with developers to resolve issues, and helps maintain a stable and reliable product.

    payment_date: Date and time of the transaction.

Relationships:

    A payment is tied to one booking.

    Each booking can have one or more payment attempts.

**5. Reviews**

Allows users to leave feedback on properties.

Key Fields:

    id: Unique identifier for the review.

    user_id: Foreign key linking to the reviewer.

    property_id: Foreign key linking to the reviewed property.

    rating: Numerical score (e.g., 1–5).

    comment: Written feedback provided by the user.

Relationships:

    A review is linked to one user and one property.

    A property can have many reviews from different users.

## **Features Breakdown**


**1. API Documentation**

    OpenAPI Standard: All backend APIs follow the OpenAPI specification, promoting clear documentation and easy integration for developers.

    Django REST Framework: Delivers a fully-featured RESTful API to perform CRUD operations on user and property data.

    GraphQL: Enables efficient and flexible data querying, allowing clients to request only the data they need.

**2. User Authentication**

    Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/

    Key Features: Supports user registration, login authentication, and profile management functionalities.

**3. Property Management**

    Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/

    Key Features: Allows users to create, view, update, and delete property listings.

**4. Booking System**

    Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/

    Key Features: Users can make new bookings, modify existing ones, and manage check-in/check-out information.

**5. Payment Processing**

    Endpoints: /payments/

**6. Review System**

    Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/

    Key Features: Enables users to submit, update, and manage reviews for listed properties.

**7. Database Optimizations**

    Indexing: Frequently queried fields are indexed to enhance search performance and reduce query time.

    Caching: Implements caching mechanisms to lower database load and improve response time across key endpoints.

    ## **API Security**

    Ensuring the security of the API is a top priority to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and prevent unauthorized access. The following key security measures are implemented in the project:


**1. Authentication**

    Implementation: Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify user identity for each request.

    Why It Matters: Prevents unauthorized access to protected endpoints and ensures that only authenticated users can interact with the system.

**2. Authorization**

    Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) to determine what actions a user can perform based on their role (e.g., guest, host, admin).

    Why It Matters: Ensures that users can only access resources they are permitted to, such as preventing guests from modifying properties they don't own.

**3. Rate Limiting**

    Implementation: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make within a specified time window.

    Why It Matters: Protects the API from abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts by slowing down or blocking excessive traffic.

**4. Data Encryption**

    Implementation: HTTPS is enforced for all API communication, and sensitive data (like passwords) is hashed before storage.

    Why It Matters: Protects data in transit and at rest, ensuring that critical information such as passwords and payment data cannot be intercepted or compromised.

**5. Input Validation & Sanitization**

    Implementation: All incoming data is validated and sanitized using serializers and custom validators.

    Why It Matters: Prevents injection attacks, such as SQL injection or XSS (Cross-site Scripting), by ensuring that only safe, expected data is processed by the backend.

**6. Secure Payment Handling**

    Implementation: Payment information is processed through a secure third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).

    Why It Matters: Avoids direct handling of sensitive financial data within the app, reducing liability and improving PCI compliance.


## **CI-CD Pipeline**

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code. These pipelines ensure that changes to the codebase are automatically validated and safely delivered to production without manual intervention.

**Why CI/CD Is Important**

    Improved Code Quality: Automated testing catches bugs and issues early in the development cycle.

    Faster Deployment: Reduces the time it takes to deliver new features or fixes to users.

    Consistency: Ensures that all environments (development, staging, production) are updated in a reliable and repeatable way.

    Developer Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deployment, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

**Tools Used**

    GitHub Actions: For automating CI workflows such as running tests, linting code, and deploying builds on push or pull requests.

    Docker: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development and deployment.

    Docker Compose: Manages multi-container applications during local development and testing.

    Optional: Integration with platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for automated deployments to staging or production environments.
