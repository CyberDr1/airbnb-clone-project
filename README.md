# airbnb-clone-project

## **Objective**

The backend of the Airbnb Clone project is built to deliver a reliable and scalable system for handling user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. It aims to replicate the essential functionalities of Airbnb, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and hosts.


**## Team Roles**

**Backend Developer**

Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side of the application, including implementing API endpoints, defining database schemas, and executing core business logic. Collaborates closely with frontend developers to ensure seamless data flow between the client and server. Also handles data validation, authentication, and integration with third-party services.

**Database Administrator (DBA)**

Oversees the structure, performance, and security of the projectâ€™s database systems. This includes designing efficient schemas, managing indexing strategies, and optimizing queries for performance. The DBA is also responsible for backups, recovery plans, and ensuring data integrity throughout the development lifecycle.

**DevOps Engineer**

Manages the deployment pipeline, infrastructure automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. Ensures the backend services are properly scaled, monitored, and highly available in various environments. They also handle incident response, system updates, and maintain secure development and production environments.

**QA Engineer**

Conducts comprehensive testing to verify that backend functionalities work as expected and meet established quality standards. This includes writing and executing unit, integration, and regression tests. The QA Engineer also documents bugs, collaborates with developers to resolve issues, and helps maintain a stable and reliable product.
